# Youtube_Playlist_Downloader
This is better than nothing. Hope this makes your life easier. :)

Change p string variable into youtube playlist link. Make sure it's temporarily set to public, if you own the playlist and if you made it private.
After using the program, you may switch the privacy of your playlist to private.

You might need to install ffmpeg for your os.
Also, some videos have different names from the title, due to the removal of some special characters, so the download repeater is not perfect. Hoping someone fixes this bug. :)
